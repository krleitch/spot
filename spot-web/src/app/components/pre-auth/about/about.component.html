      anonymously and at the same time with the friends you choose.

      <ul>
        <li>All spots and comments you make are anonymous by default.</li>
        <li>
          If you want to share with friends, @tag them in a comment and only
          they will know who you are.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are tagged back then you will know each other while still
          remaining anonymous to everyone else.

          Spot owners will be marked with the spy profile photo as seen above.
